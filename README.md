- Hosted on S3 with [CloudFront CDN](https://docs.stacktape.com/resources/cdns/) for global delivery.
- Supports environment injection at deploy time via `window.STP_INJECTED_ENV` — no rebuild needed to change config.

## 1. Generate your project
To initialize the project, use

```bash
stacktape init --starterId react-spa-vitejs
```




## 2. Deploy your stack

The deployment will take ~5-15 minutes. Subsequent deploys will be significantly faster.

<details>
<summary>Deploy from local machine</summary>

<br />

The deployment from local machine will build and deploy the application from your system. This means you also need to have:
- Node.js installed.

<br />

To perform the deployment, use the following command:

```bash
stacktape deploy --projectName <<project-name>> --stage <<stage>> --region <<region>>
```

`stage` is an arbitrary name of your environment (for example **staging**, **production** or **dev-john**)

`region` is the AWS region, where your stack will be deployed to. All the available regions are listed below.

`projectName` is the name of your project. You can create it in the console or interactively using CLI.

<br />

| Region name & Location     | code           |
  | -------------------------- | -------------- |
  | Europe (Ireland)           | eu-west-1      |

```

`stage` is an arbitrary name of your environment (for example **staging**, **production** or **dev-john**)

`region` is the AWS region, where your stack will be deployed to. All the available regions are listed below.

`projectName` is the name of your project. You can create it in the console or interactively using CLI.

## 3. Test your application

After a successful deployment, some information about the stack will be printed to the terminal (**URLs** of the deployed services, links to **logs**, **metrics**, etc.).

- Open the **CDN URL** printed to the terminal after deploy to see your app.





## 4. Hotswap deploys
- Stacktape deployments use [AWS CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html) under the hood. It
  brings a lot of guarantees and convenience, but can be slow for certain use-cases.

- To speed up the deployment, you can use the `--hotSwap` flag which avoids using Cloudformation.
- Hotswap deployments work only for source code changes (for lambda function, containers and batch jobs) and for content uploads to buckets.
- If the update deployment is not hot-swappable, Stacktape will automatically fall back to using a Cloudformation deployment.
```bash
stacktape deploy --hotSwap --stage <<stage>> --region <<region>> --projectName <<project-name>>
```

## 5. Delete your stack

- If you no longer want to use your stack, you can delete it.
- Stacktape will automatically delete every infrastructure resource and deployment artifact associated with your stack.

```bash
stacktape delete --stage <<stage>> --region <<region>>
```

# Stack description

  Stacktape uses a simple `stacktape.yml` configuration file to describe infrastructure resources, packaging, deployment
  pipeline and other aspects of your project.

  You can deploy your project to multiple environments (stages) - for
  example `production`, `staging` or `dev-john`. A stack is a running instance of an project. It consists of your application
  code (if any) and the infrastructure resources required to run it.

  The configuration for this project is described below.

  ## 1. Resources

  - Every resource must have an arbitrary, alphanumeric name (A-z0-9).
  - Stacktape resources consist of multiple underlying AWS or 3rd party resources.
### 1.1 Hosting Bucket

The hosting bucket stores the built SPA and serves it via CloudFront CDN:

- Built assets are uploaded automatically during deployment.
- CDN cache is invalidated after each deploy to serve the latest version.
- Environment variables can be injected at deploy time without rebuilding the app.

```yml
resources:
  webBucket:
    type: hosting-bucket
    properties:
      uploadDirectoryPath: ./dist
      hostingContentType: single-page-app
```

### 1.2 Build Hook

The application is built automatically before each deployment using a
[hook](https://docs.stacktape.com/configuration/hooks/).

```yml
hooks:
  beforeDeploy:
    - scriptName: build
```
